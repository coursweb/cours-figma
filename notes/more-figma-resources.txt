"the new Team Libraries introduces an easy-to-use component publishing system that lives in the cloud alongside your design documents"

"Any component you design can be published to your teamâ€™s library and pulled into any of your projects. Each instance maintains a link back to the original master component (which becomes your single source of truth)."

"I find it much easier to maintain documents dedicated to components if you have a large UI system. Because of the way Figma will organize components in the Team Libraries pane, you can use frames or groups to sort them into logical buckets (ex: buttons, tabs, form elements, alerts, etc)."
